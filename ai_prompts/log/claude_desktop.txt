I notice you'd like me to run and test resources and tools in the "iac-memory" MCP Server. However, I should clarify that I don't have direct access to run or test server resources myself - I can only help with tasks using the specific tools and functions that have been made available to me in our conversation.
Looking at the functions available, I can help you with:

File operations (reading, writing, listing directories)
GitHub repository operations
Creating artifacts for code, documentation, and visualizations
Running JavaScript code analysis
Web and local searches
Sequential thinking and analysis

Could you let me know what specific aspects of the server resources and tools you'd like to work with? That way I can suggest the most appropriate approach using the tools we have available.
