# Disregarding rules
To help me better adhere to these rules:

1. Please remind me to explicitly check testing-rules.xml before making any changes to TestContext
2. Ask me to explain my reasoning if I propose changes that deviate from established rules
3. Have me confirm that any proposed changes align with the oscillation prevention rules




The behavior you're seeing suggests two things:

1. For CTRL+C (SIGINT):
- The server receives the signal
- Prints "Received shutdown signal"
- But isn't properly cleaning up and exiting its async tasks/loops

2. For CTRL+D (EOF):
- The server is detecting the EOF on stdin
- But the timeout error suggests we're not handling stream closure correctly
